# Animation Chart Maker
Check it out on https://chartmaker.a-wels.de
## What
This is a simple website created with svelte that allows the creation of animation charts. Keyframes can be arranged manually or with presets.
The chart can be flipped, frame numbers adjusted and much more.
## Why?
My sister is studying animation and mentioned that animation charts are kinda annoying to make.
With some feedback from her and people from her sphere I created this tool.

## Feedback
If you have any feedback (bugs/feature ideas) please create an issue or send me a mail :)
